Tic-Tac-Toe
Hello everyone! Habi in touch! 
Today I post my tic-tac-toe. To do this, I created a Custom View, namely a View that creates a 3x3 table. 
Initially, I also wanted to draw crosses and zeroes using canvas, but I found such beautiful pictures in Google that I changed my mind and did it through ImageView.
Actually get acquainted with my code.
